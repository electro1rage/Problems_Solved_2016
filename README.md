# Problems_Solved_2016
This repo will have the codes of the problems that I solved in 2016.
This repo won't be categorised like the last one, I think i made enough problems for each category the last time.
Problems from livearchive will be named in this format: LiveArchive_<problem_id> (ex. LiveArchive_3752).
Problems from codeforces will be named in this format: CF_Div<division_number>_<problem_id> (ex. CF_Div2_320C).
Problems from TopCoder will be named in this format: <problem_class_name>.
